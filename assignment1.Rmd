# Introduction
This document contains all the documentation for Assignment 1.

## R Installation
Followed the instructions on CRAN and installed the latest R and RStudio.

## Basic R Operations

### Task4
```{r}
sqrt(10)  # Square root of 10
log2(32)  # Log base 2 of 32
sum(1:1000)  # Sum of numbers from 1 to 1000
sum(seq(2, 1000, by = 2))  # Sum of even numbers from 2 to 1000
choose(100, 2)  # Pairwise comparisons of 100 genes
choose(100, 3)  # Arranging 100 genes in triple
```

### Task5
```{r}
data("CO2")
?CO2 # description of CO2 dataset
mean(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Quebec"])
median(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Quebec"])
mean(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Mississippi"])
median(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Mississippi"])
```

### Task6
#### 1. a function that calculates the ratio of the mean and the median of a given vector. This is a helpful measure to detect data with outlying values.
```{r}
ratio_mean_median <- function(x) {
    mean(x) / median(x)
}
```
#### 2. a function that ignores the lowest and the highest value from a given vector and calculate the mean.
```{r}
trimmed_mean <- function(x) {
    mean(x[x != min(x) & x != max(x)])
}
```
#### 3. Read about piping from here:https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html#pipes (you don’t have to learn everything, a basic understanding of the usage is enough). Write a short (max. 300 characters, no spaces) explanation of why, how, and when not to use pipes.
Pipes (%>%) simplify sequential operations, improving readability. Use them for short, linear transformations. Avoid pipes for long sequences (10+ steps), multiple inputs/outputs, or complex dependencies.
#### 4. Write a short explanation (max. 300 characters, no spaces) of why they could be useful in your work.
The apply family streamlines data analysis by replacing explicit loops, making code more readable and efficient. In RNAseq and genomics, they help process large datasets, compute statistics across genes/samples, and apply transformations efficiently, crucial for differential expression and enrichment analyses.

### Task7
```{r}
# read magic_guys.csv and check the dataflame structure
setwd("~/Google Drive/My Drive/0_Iden2/KI-UT_doctoral_course")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
df <- read.csv("magic_guys.csv")
str(df)
summary(df)
unique(df$species)
```
#### 1. Compare the distributions of the body heights of the two species from the 'magic_guys.csv' dataset graphically
##### a. using the basic 'hist' function as well as ‘ggplot’ and ‘geom_histogram’ functions from the ggplot2 package. Optimize the plots for example by trying several different 'breaks'. Note that ggplot2-based functions give you many more options for changing the visualization parameters, try some of them.
hist
```{r}
length_jedi <- df$length[df$species == "jedi"]
length_sith <- df$length[df$species == "sith"]
hist(length_jedi)
hist(length_jedi, breaks = 10) # Set bin numver to ten. Does not look good.
hist(length_jedi, breaks = "FD") # Freedman-Diaconis's rule. Consider data variation, so can choose better bin number compared with default (Sturges's rule). This time, the result was same as default.
hist(length_jedi, col = rgb(1, 0, 0, 0.5), main = "Length Distribution of Jedi",
xlab = "Length", border = "white") # Changed color and added title. 
hist(length_sith, col = rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.5), main = "Length Distribution of Sith", xlab = "Length", border = "white") # Sith dataset

# add two datasets by using same bin number (failed because bin is diffferent)
hist(length_jedi, breaks = 7, col = rgb(1, 0, 0, 0.5), main = "Length Distribution of Jedi",
xlab = "Length", border = "white") 
hist(length_sith, breaks = 7, col = rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.5), main = "Length Distribution of Sith",
xlab = "Length", add = TRUE, border = "white") # add histogram to the histgram generated before.
legend("topright", legend = c("Jedi", "Sith"), fill = c(rgb(1, 0, 0, 0.5), rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.5))) # add caption.
```
ggplot and geom_histogram (ggplot2)
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = length, fill = species)) +
geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity", bins = 20) +
labs(title = "Length Distribution by Species", x = "Length", y = "Count") +
theme_minimal() # bins=20
ggplot(df, aes(x = length, fill = species)) +
geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity", bins = 10) +
labs(title = "Length Distribution by Species", x = "Length", y = "Count") +
theme_minimal() # bins=10. Looks smoother than bins=20.
```
##### b. Do the same comparison as in a. but with boxplots. If you want to use the ggplot2-package, use the functions ‘ggplot’ and ‘geom_boxplot’
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = species, y = length, fill = species)) +
geom_boxplot() +
labs(title = "Boxplot of Length by Species", x = "Species", y = "Length") +
theme_minimal()
```
##### c. Save the plots with the ‘png’, ‘pdf’, and ‘svg’ formats. In which situation would you use which file format?
```{r}
# ggsave function saves the most recently created plot, so I first ran ggplot and then saved the plots.
ggplot(df, aes(x = length, fill = species)) +
geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity", bins = 10) +
labs(title = "Length Distribution by Species", x = "Length", y = "Count") +
theme_minimal() # bins=10. Looks smoother than bins=20.
ggsave("histogram.png")
ggsave("histogram.pdf")
ggsave("histogram.svg")

ggplot(df, aes(x = species, y = length, fill = species)) +
geom_boxplot() +
labs(title = "Boxplot of Length by Species", x = "Species", y = "Length") +
theme_minimal()
ggsave("boxplot.png")
ggsave("boxplot.pdf")
ggsave("boxplot.svg")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
data <- data.frame(
  Format = c("PNG", "PDF", "SVG"),
  `Best For` = c("Web, presentations, quick sharing",
                 "Printing, scientific papers, LaTeX",
                 "Web graphics, scalable vector editing"),
  Pros = c("Good balance of quality and file size, transparency support",
           "High-quality, vector format",
           "Infinite scalability, editable"),
  Cons = c("Resolution-dependent, loses quality when resized",
           "Large file sizes, not ideal for web",
           "Large file size for complex plots, limited support in some platforms")
)
kable(data, format = "markdown", caption = "Comparison of File Formats for ggplot2")
```
#### 2. Load the gene expression data matrix from the ‘microarray_data.tab’ dataset provided in the shared folder, it is a big tabular separated matrix.
##### a. How big is the matrix in terms of rows and columns?
```{r}
microarray <- read.table("microarray_data.tab", header = TRUE, sep = "\t") # There's no row name in column 1, so read the file without using row.names=1.
dim(microarray) # (row number, column number)
```
##### b. Count the missing values per gene and visualize this result.
```{r}
library(pheatmap) # Maybe don't need to load this package. is.na() is a standard function of R.
missing_values <- rowSums(is.na(microarray)) # Count missing values.
hist(missing_values, breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Missing Values per Gene",
xlab = "Number of Missing Values", col = "blue") # Histogram of missing values. Generated using hist function.

# I'm not sure, but the column name (g1, g2, ...) means gene name? If that's true, I must count missing values per column. The result is as follows.
missing_values_col <- colSums(is.na(microarray))
hist(missing_values_col, breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Missing Values per Gene",
xlab = "Number of Missing Values", col = "blue")
```
##### c. Find the genes for which there are more than X% (X=10%, 20%, 50%) missing values.
```{r}
total_samples <- ncol(microarray)
print(total_samples)
threshold_10 <- total_samples * 0.1
threshold_20 <- total_samples * 0.2
threshold_50 <- total_samples * 0.5
genes_10 <- rownames(microarray)[missing_values > threshold_10]
genes_20 <- rownames(microarray)[missing_values > threshold_20]
genes_50 <- rownames(microarray)[missing_values > threshold_50]
print(genes_10)
print(genes_20)
print(genes_50)

# Again, I'm not sure, but the column name (g1, g2, ...) means gene name? If that's true, I must count missing values per column. The result is as follows.
total_samples_row <- nrow(microarray)
print(total_samples_row)
threshold_10_row <- total_samples_row * 0.1
threshold_20_row <- total_samples_row * 0.2
threshold_50_row <- total_samples_row * 0.5
genes_10_row <- colnames(microarray)[missing_values_col > threshold_10_row]
genes_20_row <- colnames(microarray)[missing_values_col > threshold_20_row]
genes_50_row <- colnames(microarray)[missing_values_col > threshold_50_row]
print(genes_10_row)
print(genes_20_row)
print(genes_50_row)
```
##### d. Replace the missing values by the average expression value for the particular gene. (Note: Imputing data has to be used with caution!)
```{r}
microarray_filled <- microarray
for (i in 1:nrow(microarray_filled)) {
microarray_filled[i, is.na(microarray_filled[i, ])] <- mean(microarray_filled[i, ], na.rm = TRUE)
} # Not good. Yieled more than 50 warnings.

# Fill missing values row by row using apply(), because the code above that uses for loop yielded more than 50 warnings.
microarray_filled <- microarray
microarray_filled <- t(apply(microarray_filled, 1, function(x) {
  x[is.na(x)] <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(x)
}))
```
I'm not sure if i succeeded in this.
#### 3. Visualize the data in the CO2 dataset in a way that gives you a deeper understanding of the data. What do you see?
```{r}
# distribution of CO2 uptake by plant type (quebec or mississippi)
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = Type, y = uptake, fill = Type)) +
geom_boxplot() +
labs(title = "CO2 Uptake by Type", x = "Plant Type", y = "CO2 Uptake") +
theme_minimal()
```
Quebec has higher CO2 uptake.
```{r}
# distribution of CO2 uptake by treatment (chilled or nonchilled)
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = Treatment, y = uptake, fill = Treatment)) +
geom_boxplot() +
labs(title = "CO2 Uptake by Treatment", x = "Treatment", y = "CO2 Uptake") +
theme_minimal()
```
Nonchilled group has higher CO2 uptake.
```{r}
# scatter plot of CO2 uptake and CO2 concentration. Chilled and nonchilled.
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Type)) +
geom_point() +
facet_wrap(~Treatment) +
labs(title = "CO2 Uptake vs. Concentration", x = "CO2 Concentration", y = "CO2 Uptake") +
theme_minimal()
```
Regardless of chilled/nonchilled and quebec/mississippi, Co2 uptake increases by ambient CO2 concentration. However, the difference of co2 uptake ability between quebec and mississippi broadens in chilled condition. Mississipi plants tend to be less tolerant to cold stimulus.
```{r}
# CO2 uptake by each plant
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = Plant, y = uptake, fill = Plant)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "CO2 Uptake by Individual Plant", x = "Plant", y = "CO2 Uptake") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

### Task8
#### 1. Install the Tidybiology package, which includes the data ‘chromosome’ and ‘proteins’
```{r}
# I didn't have devtools, so I installed using install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("hirscheylab/tidybiology")
library(tidybiology)

# read data
data(chromosome)
data(proteins)
```
##### a. Extract summary statistics (mean, median and maximum) for the following variables from the ‘chromosome’ data: variations, protein coding genes, and miRNAs. Utilize the tidyverse functions to make this as simply as possible.
```{r}
head(chromosome)
str(chromosome)

chromosome %>%
  summarise(
    mean_variations = mean(variations, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_variations = median(variations, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_variations = max(variations, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
##### b. How does the chromosome size distribute? Plot a graph that helps to visualize this by using ggplot2 package functions.
```{r}
# show by chromosome DNA basepairs
ggplot(chromosome, aes(x = basepairs)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Chromosome Size Distribution", x = "Size", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# show by chromosome physical length
ggplot(chromosome, aes(x = length_mm)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
labs(title = "Chromosome Size Distribution", x = "Size", y = "Count") +
theme_minimal()
```
##### c. Does the number of protein coding genes or miRNAs correlate with the length of the chromosome? Make two separate plots to visualize these relationships.
```{r}
# by basepairs
ggplot(chromosome, aes(x = basepairs, y = protein_codinggenes)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
labs(title = "Protein Coding Genes vs Chromosome Basepairs", x = "Chromosome Basepairs", y = "Protein Coding Genes")

# by physical length
ggplot(chromosome, aes(x = length_mm, y = protein_codinggenes)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
labs(title = "Protein Coding Genes vs Chromosome Physical Size", x = "Chromosome Physical Size", y = "Protein Coding Genes")
```
##### d. Calculate the same summary statistics for the ‘proteins’ data variables length and mass. Create a meaningful visualization of the relationship between these two variables by utilizing the ggplot2 package functions. Play with the colors, theme- and other visualization parameters to create a plot that pleases you.
```{r}
# check structure
head(proteins)
str(proteins)

# summary statistics
proteins %>%
  summarise(
    mean_length = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_length = median(length, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_length = max(length, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_mass = median(mass, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_mass = max(mass, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# relationship between protein length and protein mass
ggplot(proteins, aes(x = length, y = mass, color = length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +  # scatter plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", se = TRUE) +  # regression line
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +  # color gradation
  labs(title = "Protein Length vs Mass",
       x = "Protein Length (Amino Acids)",
       y = "Protein Mass (Da)",
       color = "Length") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 14),  # text size
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")  # centered title
  )
```
